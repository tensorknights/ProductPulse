*Unleash the Power of Support Data*

##Problem statement
Infer data from support tickets to make data-informed decisions, enhance product quality, optimize customer support processes, and ultimately drive positive business outcomes, including improved customer satisfaction, increased customer retention, and business growth

##Solution
Infer qualitative and factual information such as user emotion while writing the ticket, summary, feature request, issue type, priotiy, product mentioned from support tickets using OpenAI APIs and create easy to understand visualisation basis the inferred data.

##Callouts
1. Chain of messages between the user and the agent in a support ticket can't be read at the moment as it requires some more development
2. We are using only the generic model from openAI for all tasks while there are specifc models that perform better at certain jobs[such as text-curie-003 do better and cheaper summarisation]. This will not only improve the accuracy of answers but will also result in reduced cost.
3. Frontend dashboards are yet to be done for visualing the data
